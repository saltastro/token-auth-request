Installation
============

Python version
--------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python 3. Python 2 is not supported; it may or may not work.

Installing token-auth-requests
------------------------------

You may install token-auth-requests in the usual way with pip, preferably in a virtual environment.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install token-auth-requests

And that's it, really. All the necessary dependencies will automatically be installed by pip.
