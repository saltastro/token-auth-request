token-auth-request
==================

Introduction
------------

It often makes sense to pair a web-based API with a Python-based library for easy access. If the API use requires authentication, the library must be able to handle it. While this certainly can be achieved on an ad hoc basis, it seems more reasonable to encapsulate the authentication handling into a Python package of its own.

`token-auth-request` does precisely that. It accepts a username and password and uses them to request an authentication token, which is used for subsequent HTTP calls. The token is stored, and a new token is automatically requested if the current one has expired.

Conceptual Solution
-------------------

The `token-auth-request` package provides exactly one method, `auth_session`. This accepts a username, password and a URL. It returns an object which has all the methods of the `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ library's Session class.

Whenever a method corresponding to an HTTP verb (i.e. DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT or a custom verb) is called on this object, the object will first check whether it has a non-expired authentication token. Here non-expired means that the expiry time is in the past or within the next minute. If it has not expired, it sends an HTTP request to the URL passed to the `auth_session`. This request must look as follows.

=====================  ============================================
Property               Value                                       
=====================  ============================================
HTTP method            POST                                        
Content-Type header    application/json                            
Payload                { username: username, password: password }  
=====================  ============================================

The response is expected to look as follows.

=====================  =======================================
Property               Value                                  
=====================  =======================================
HTTP status code       200                                    
Content-Type header    application/json                       
Data                   { token: token, expires_in: seconds }  
=====================  =======================================

For example, if the username and password passed to `auth_session` are `sipho` and `topsecret`, the token generated for the user is `abcd1234` and the token expires in 500 seconds, then the request should have the payload

.. code-block:: json
   
   {
       "username": "sipho",
       "password": "topsecret"
   }

and the response data should be

.. code-block:: json
   
   {
       "token": "abcd1234",
       "expires_in": 500
   }


Both the token and its expiry time are stored. After that, or if there was a non-expired token already, the token is added as an HTTP header with key `Authentication` and value `Token xyz` (where `xyx` denotes the token) to the session. For example, for the token above the header would look be

::
   Authentication: Token abcd1234

Only then is the actual HTTP method of the `requests` Session class called. All positional and keyword arguments are passed on as is.

The object has a `logout` method, which removes the username, password, token and expiry time.

The package also defines an exception type `AuthException`. An `AuthException` should be raised if the server replies with a 401 error when a token is requested, or if an HTTP request is made after the object's `logout` method has been called.

Tests
-----

The package must pass the following tests.

1. If a correct username and password are passed to `token_session`, the first time one of the HTTP verb methods is called on the returned object, a POST request to the given URL is made with the username and password passed as a JSON string. Assuming the token has not expired, further calls don't make such a request.
2. If a correct username and password are passed to `token_session`, assuming the token has not expired, all subsequent HTTP requests (after the initial request for a token) have an Authentication header with the correct string.
3. If an HTTP request is made and the current token's expiry time is less than one minute in the future, a new token is requested and subsequent HTTP requests use the new token in the Authentication header.
4. The logout method removes username, password, token and expiry date.
5. An AuthException is raised if the server replies with a 401 error when a token is requested.
6. An AuthException is raised if an HTTP request is made after the logout method has been called.
7. An exception is raised if the server replies with a status code other than 200 or 401.

Implementation
--------------

The `auth_session` method returns an instance of a class `AuthSession`. This class has the following properties:

=============  ===========================================================
Property       Description                                                
=============  ===========================================================
username       Username passed to `auth_session`                          
password       Password passed to `auth_session`                          
auth_url       Authentication URl, as passed to `auth_session`            
token          Token returned by the server                               
expiry_time    Datetime when the token expires                            
logged_out     Flag indicating whether the logout method has been called  
_session       requests Session instance                                  
=============  ===========================================================

The class also implements the `__getattr__` method. This checks whether the argument is a `requests` Session corresponding to an HTTP verb. If so, it makes sure that the `logged_out` flag is `False` (and throws an `AuthException` if that is not the case). It then checks whether there is a non-expired token and, if so, calls the method on `_session`. Otherwise, it tries to get a token from the server, adds the token as an HTTP header to `_session` and then calls the method on `_session`.

The class also has a method `logout`, which sets the username, password, token and expiry_time to `None` and the `logged_out` flag to `True`.
